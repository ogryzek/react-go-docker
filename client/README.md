# client: react app

This application serves as the client in a ReactJS client/Go server application, to be used with a single Dockerfile. See the README in the base directory for more information.  
  
The app logic here is in the `src/PingComponent.js` component, which is imported and used in `src/App.js`.  
  
**TODO**: Explain this application better and/or link to a more relevant explanation.
